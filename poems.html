        title: "Adventure of the Sky",
        content: `Up in the sky where the bluebirds fly,  
Clouds like cotton gently glide by.  
I close my eyes and soar so high,  
With wings of hope, I touch the sky.

Beyond the stars, through galaxy gates,  
I ride on dreams and twist through fates.  
A comet's tail, a moonbeam‚Äôs grace,  
The sky‚Äôs a never-ending place.

I land upon a planet green,  
With silver trees and sparkling streams.  
The air is light, the breeze is sweet,  
Adventure waits beneath my feet.
`
      },
      {
        title: "Think Big",
        content: `A tiny thought inside your mind  
Can build a world for humankind.  
A whisper turns into a shout,  
Ideas grow and travel out.

The biggest dreams you dare to say  
Might just come true some golden day.  
The journey‚Äôs long, the road is steep,  
But faith and hope are yours to keep.

Think big, my friend, let nothing stop‚Äî  
You just might climb right to the top.  
Believe in you, believe you can,  
And chase your dreams with every plan.
`

        title: "My Animal Parade",
        content: `Lions roar and parrots squawk,  
Penguins waddle when they walk.  
Zebras march in perfect line,  
Monkeys swing and birds align.

Elephants trumpet, dolphins spin,  
Cheetahs dash with flashy grins.  
Tigers pounce and pandas crawl,  
Bunnies bounce and crickets call.

This animal parade I see  
Lives inside the heart of me.  
Books and stories make it real‚Äî  
Imagination‚Äôs greatest deal!
`
      },
      {
        title: "Whispers of the Forest",
        content: `The forest speaks in sounds so small,  
The rustling leaves, the owl's call.  
The crunch of twigs beneath my feet,  
A hidden trail, a mossy seat.

The breeze that hums a secret song,  
The stream that carries dreams along.  
A fox with eyes so calm and wise,  
A hawk that circles open skies.

Here nature tells me what to do‚Äî  
To sit, to breathe, to just be you.  
I find my peace in green and shade,  
Within the forest gently laid.
`

      {
        title: " The Day I Painted Rainbows",
        content: `With paints in hand and skies so gray,  
I made a rainbow every way.  
I brushed the clouds in shades so wide,  
The sun peeked out and beamed with pride.

Red for courage, bold and bright,  
Orange for joy, a glowing light.  
Yellow for laughter, pure and free,  
Green for dreams that grow like trees.

Blue for peace inside my heart,  
Indigo‚Äôs the artist‚Äôs part.  
Violet? That magic thread‚Äî  
The color dancing in my head.

I painted rainbows through the rain,  
And found the light in every pain.
`
      },
      {
        title: "My Compass",
        content: `Sometimes I wander, lose my way,  
Unsure of what to do or say.  
But deep inside, I hold a tool‚Äî  
A compass made from heart and school.

It points to truth, it points to kind,  
It helps me clear a cluttered mind.  
It guides me through each stormy part,  
With hope and courage from my heart.

And when the road seems dark and wild,  
I trust the compass of a child.  
It leads me where I need to go,  
To learn, to grow, to brightly glow.

`

      {
        title: " Nighttime Dreams",
        content: `The stars appear in velvet skies,  
Like tiny lamps with sleepy eyes.  
The moon climbs high, its silver gleam  
Invites me to a world of dream.

A boat of light takes me away  
To castles made of soft sunrays.  
I dance with shadows, laugh with time,  
And climb tall trees of lullaby rhyme.

Each dream I hold, each story spun,  
Is mine to keep until the sun.  
Then morning calls with bright sunlight‚Äî  
Goodbye, sweet stars, until tonight.

`
      },
      {
        title: "Slow and Steady",
        content: `They said I‚Äôd never win the race,  
I don‚Äôt have speed, I don‚Äôt have grace.  
But every step I take is true‚Äî  
I don‚Äôt give up like others do.

I might be slow, but I am smart,  
And I have courage in my heart.  
So while they run and leap ahead,  
I follow paths my soul has led.

And when I reach the finish line,  
I know that every inch is mine.  
Not first or fast, but strong and proud,  
With steady steps, I cheer out loud!

`
      },
      {
        title: "Shine On",
        content: `The world can feel so big and tall,  
And sometimes I might feel so small.  
But every person, big or slight,  
Deserves to shine with glowing light.

A smile can warm the coldest day,  
A kind word helps in every way.  
So I will shine just being me,  
A gentle sun that all can see.

I‚Äôll light the path with what I do,  
With all my heart, I‚Äôll journey through.  
So when I doubt or fear has won‚Äî  
I‚Äôll rise, I‚Äôll try, I‚Äôll shine like sun.

    title : "The Wizard of Wishes",
    content: `Deep in the woods where willows weep,  
A wizard wakes from starry sleep.  
He stirs a brew of dreams and light,  
And whispers hopes into the night.

He doesn‚Äôt cast spells big or loud,  
But soft and kind, not stern or proud.  
He grants you courage when you fear,  
And helps your heart feel strong and clear.

He teaches that the realest spell  
Is knowing that you're doing well.  
That trying, falling, trying again  
Will make you wise beyond all men.

So if you wish for something great,  
Be patient, brave, and never wait.  
The wizard‚Äôs magic lives in you‚Äî  
Just trust yourself in all you do.
`

{
    title: "To the Moon and Back",
    content: `I built a ship from paper dreams,  
And sailed beyond the starry beams.  
Past satellites and shiny rings,  
Through Milky Way and meteor wings.

The moon looked down and gave a grin,  
‚ÄúCome closer, child, come settle in.‚Äù  
I bounced and floated on its ground,  
In weightless joy, no need for sound.

I told the stars my name and age,  
They laughed and turned another page.  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a spark,‚Äù the North Star said,  
‚ÄúA heart that lights the path ahead.‚Äù

Then home I flew with moon-dust boots,  
And sky-high tales as shining fruits.  
To dreamers, yes, I made a pact‚Äî  
I‚Äôve been to space. I‚Äôm coming back!
`
},
{
    title: "The Mirror Doesn‚Äôt Lie",
    content: `I stood before the mirror tall,  
Expecting flaws, expecting small.  
But what I saw was something more‚Äî  
A soul that‚Äôs strong, a heart that soars.

It showed my eyes, not just their hue,  
But all the things those eyes have viewed.  
It showed my smile, not just the teeth,  
But joy and kindness hid beneath.

The mirror didn‚Äôt laugh or frown,  
It simply stared, up and down.  
And in its calm, reflective grace,  
It showed me truth in every face.

That I am made of stars and clay,  
Of rainy nights and sunny day.  
And when I doubt or wonder why,  
I look again‚Äîthe mirror doesn‚Äôt lie.
`
},
{
   title: "The Island of Me",
   content: `
}I found an island, far at sea,  
And carved it in the shape of ‚ÄúMe.‚Äù  
With beaches made from all my laughs,  
And caves that echo all my crafts.

The trees grew tall with every dream,  
The rivers hummed with every theme.  
I planted forests rich and wide,  
Of stories that I keep inside.

The clouds above were soft and true,  
They carried poems that I knew.  
And every step upon the sand  
Reminded me of who I am.

This island lives in heart and mind‚Äî  
A place where I‚Äôm allowed to shine.  
So if the world gets loud or tough,  
I sail back home‚Äîit's just enough.`
},
{
    title : "Time Is a Traveler",
    content: `Time wears boots and marches far,  
Across the hills to where dreams are.  
It carries maps of things we‚Äôll do,  
Of goals we‚Äôll reach and moments too.

Sometimes it strolls, sometimes it flies,  
It draws the sunsets in the skies.  
It teaches us to use each day,  
To speak with care, to laugh and play.

It doesn‚Äôt stop for fear or doubt,  
But helps us find what life‚Äôs about.  
With every tick and every tock,  
It whispers, ‚ÄúGo unlock your clock.‚Äù

So don‚Äôt just watch the time go past,  
Fill it with love and make it last.  
Be present, kind, and wild and free‚Äî  
Time is a traveler, just like me.
